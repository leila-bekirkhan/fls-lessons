          <h2>Causes of climate change</h2>
          <p>Climate change is driven primarily by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. These activities release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising global temperatures.</p>
          <p>Deforestation is another significant contributor to climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and when forests are cleared, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere, accelerating the warming process.</p>
          <p>Other human activities, such as industrial processes, agriculture, and waste management, also play a role in increasing the levels of greenhouse gases, exacerbating the problem of global climate change.</p>
          <p>While many believe that climate change is <span class="strike">irreversible</span>, there is still hope if we act quickly and collectively.</p>

        <!-- Second block: Effects of climate change -->
        <section class="section" id="effects">
          <h2>Effects of climate change</h2>
          <p>The effects of climate change are far-reaching, with rising temperatures leading to more frequent and severe weather events such as <span class="accent">hurricanes</span>, <span class="accent">heatwaves</span>, and <span class="accent">floods</span>. These extreme conditions threaten ecosystems, human health, and infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Melting polar ice caps and glaciers are causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities and increasing the risk of flooding in low-lying areas. This poses a significant threat to millions of people worldwide.</p>
          <p>Climate change also disrupts food production and water supply, making it harder for populations to access basic resources. In many regions, these disruptions are already leading to food insecurity and displacement of communities.</p>
